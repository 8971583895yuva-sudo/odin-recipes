	<h3>Description</h3><br>
	<p>Lasagna, also known by the plural form lasagne, is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is used to make the dish lasagna by stacking layers of pasta, alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.[1] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting dish is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p><br>

<ul>
	<li>Lasagna Noodles: 12 uncooked lasagna noodles (approximately 16 oz / 450 g)</li>
	<li>Meat: ½ pound lean ground beef (225 g) and ½ pound Italian sausage (225 g)</li>	
	<li>Aromatics: 1 yellow onion, diced (approximately 1 cup / 150 g), 2 cloves garlic, minced (approximately 1 tablespoon / 10 g)</li>
	<li>Sauce Base: 36 ounces pasta sauce (1.1 kg), 2 tablespoons tomato paste (30 ml)</li>
	<li>Cheeses: 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (1.1 kg), divided; ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese (50 g), divided; 2 cups 	ricotta cheese (475 g), or cottage cheese (450 g)</li>
	<li>Seasonings: ¾ teaspoon salt (4 g), more to taste; ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning (2.5 g); ¼ teaspoon black pepper (1.25 	g); ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley (15 g)</li>
	<li>Binding Agent: 1 large egg (50 g), beaten</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
<li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with additional salt if desired.
In a separate medium bowl, combine 1½ cups mozzarella cheese, ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, ricotta cheese, chopped parsley, and the beaten egg.</li>
<li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of the 9x13-inch baking dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat this layering process two more times. Finish with 3 noodles topped with the remaining sauce.</li>
<li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining 2½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup Parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired for a crispier top.</li>
<li>Rest the lasagna for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
